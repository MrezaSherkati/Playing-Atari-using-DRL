# Playing-Atari-using-DRL

## Introduction

In this project, I used Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches to play Breakout Atari game. I used Q-Learning as my Reinforcement Learning method and designed a Convolutional Neural Network as my Deep Learning architecture.

## How to run the code

First, download the code files in the "Code Files" folder, Then run the "final.py" python file.
